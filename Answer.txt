3. Passing parameter
- After the call to swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), the titles of the two objects remain unchanged because:
   + When calling swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD (which are references 
     to DigitalVideoDisc objects) are passed to the swap method as copies of the references.
   + Inside the method, the references o1 and o2 are swapped, but this change only applies to the local 
     copies (o1 and o2), not to the original references (jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD) in the calling method.
- It changed because:
   + When the dvd.setTitle(title) line is executed, the title of the jungleDVD object (which dvd references)
     is updated to the value of cinderellaDVD.getTitle().
   + The change is applied directly to the actual object in memory because the dvd reference points to
     the same object as jungleDVD.
   + When dvd = new DigitalVideoDisc(oldTitle) is executed, it only reassigns the local dvd reference to
     point to a new object. This does not change the original jungleDVD reference outside the method.
